## Git та GitHub

After completing 2 weeks of the course **Introduction to Git and GitHub**, `I've wrapped my head around all these new concepts`.

Learning at **LearnGitBranching** was like playing a game where you have to pass levels. I liked the visualization of what happens behind the scenes of the command line.
I am going to apply the acquired skills to store my code's history in Git and collaborate with others in GitHub.
