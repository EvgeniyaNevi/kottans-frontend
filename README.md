## Git та GitHub

After completing 2 weeks of the course **Introduction to Git and GitHub**, `I've wrapped my head around all these new concepts`.

Learning at **LearnGitBranching** was like playing a game where you have to pass levels. I liked the visualization of what happens behind the scenes of the command line.
I am going to apply the acquired skills to store my code's history in Git and collaborate with others in GitHub.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP
Linux Survival course provides all the fundamentals of Linux. I am familiar with basic Linux commands. 
New ones were: `man`, `ps` (with its option `aux`), `grep` and `|` symbol, which sends output to another program.
`kill` command, which tells a process to die gracefully, and its option `-9`, which tells a process to die immediately, suprised me.
The course helped me understand the important aspects of working with Linux that I will use in the future.
